In this experience, you join a troop of Wilderness Explorers at Disney's Animal Kingdom park.
You can earn badges by visiting various stations throughout the park. At some stations, you
will participate in an educational experience where you learn about wildlife, nature and
even other cultures. At other stations you will help solve puzzles.

If you collect all the 31 badges, you become a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
