You can help Perry the Platypus stop the evil Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz in seven
different missions throughout the World Showcase at Disney's Epcot park.

Each mission takes place at a different country pavillion. During the mission,
you'll activate interactive experiences as you explore the location. You are guided
on your mission by a handheld eletronic device called a F.O.N.E.
