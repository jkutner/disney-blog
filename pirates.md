This is an interactive attraction at Disney's Magic Kingdom park. Players
travel throughout Adventureland hunting for treasure in five different
scenarios. Each scenario has it's own map that guides you on your quest.

The locations in the quests have interactive experiences that are activated
by the player's talisman, which is a starfish token obtained at the pirate
recuiting center near Frontierland.
